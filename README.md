# Ascii-Player
An app to display videos as ASCII-video. The diffrence between this prokect and my "ascii-video" is that this doesn't write the video, but it doesn't need to - it opens a video and displays its "ASCII version" directly, without pre-building video. Also i've added to it a "player" part, so it functions as a simple player, with simple ASCII interface.
