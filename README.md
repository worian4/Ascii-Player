# Ascii-Player
An app to display videos as ASCII-video. The diffrence between this prokect and my ```scii-video``` is that this doesn't write the video, but it doesn't need to - it opens a video and displays its "ASCII version" directly, without pre-building video. Also i've added to it a "player" part, so it functions as a simple player, with simple ASCII interface.

Usage: when you're done with building, you'll have an ```ASCII_Player.exe``` file, so you'll have to choose a video, then choose "open with" and search for the file, and that's it. The first time it'll open with latency, so you'll have to wait some time.
